  <p>I'll be the one that stays 'til the end
    And I'll be the one that needs you again
    And I'll be the one that proposes in a garden of roses
    And truly loves you long after our curtain closes
    But will you still love me when nobody wants me around?
    When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?
    'Cause I am the one that's waited this long
    And I am the one that might get it wrong
    And I'll be the one that will love you the way I'm supposed to, girl, oh
    But will you still love me when nobody wants me around, around?
    When I turn eighty-one and forget things, will you still be proud?
    Proud of me and my short list of accomplishments, say

    Wish you nothing but a happy new version of you
